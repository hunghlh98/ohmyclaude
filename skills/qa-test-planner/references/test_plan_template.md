# Test Plan Template & Execution Tracking

Templates and workflow for planning, executing, and reporting on QA efforts.

---

## Test Plan Structure

```markdown
# Test Plan: [Feature/Release Name]

## Executive Summary
- Feature/product being tested
- Testing objectives
- Key risks
- Timeline overview

## Test Scope

**In Scope:**
- Features to be tested
- Test types (functional, UI, performance)
- Platforms and environments
- User flows and scenarios

**Out of Scope:**
- Features not being tested
- Known limitations
- Third-party integrations (if applicable)

## Test Strategy

**Test Types:**
- Manual testing
- Exploratory testing
- Regression testing
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing

**Test Approach:**
- Black box testing
- Positive and negative testing
- Boundary value analysis
- Equivalence partitioning

## Test Environment
- Operating systems
- Browsers and versions
- Devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Test data requirements
- Backend/API environments

## Entry Criteria
- [ ] Requirements documented
- [ ] Designs finalized
- [ ] Test environment ready
- [ ] Test data prepared
- [ ] Build deployed

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] All high-priority test cases executed
- [ ] 90%+ test case pass rate
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed
- [ ] No open high-severity bugs
- [ ] Regression suite passed

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Mitigation] |

## Test Deliverables
- Test plan document
- Test cases
- Test execution reports
- Bug reports
- Test summary report
```

## Test Run Report Template

```markdown
# Test Run: [Release Version]

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Build:** v2.5.0-rc1
**Tester:** [Name]
**Environment:** Staging

## Summary
- Total Test Cases: 150
- Executed: 145
- Passed: 130
- Failed: 10
- Blocked: 5
- Not Run: 5
- Pass Rate: 90%

## Test Cases by Priority

| Priority | Total | Pass | Fail | Blocked |
|----------|-------|------|------|---------|
| P0 (Critical) | 25 | 23 | 2 | 0 |
| P1 (High) | 50 | 45 | 3 | 2 |
| P2 (Medium) | 50 | 45 | 3 | 2 |
| P3 (Low) | 25 | 17 | 2 | 1 |

## Critical Failures
- TC-045: Payment processing fails
  - Bug: BUG-234
  - Status: Open

## Blocked Tests
- TC-112: Dashboard widget (API endpoint down)

## Risks
- 2 critical bugs blocking release
- Payment integration needs attention

## Next Steps
- Retest after BUG-234 fix
- Complete remaining 5 test cases
- Run full regression before sign-off
```

## Coverage Matrix

```markdown
## Coverage Matrix

| Feature | Requirements | Test Cases | Status | Gaps |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------|------|
| Login | 8 | 12 | Complete | None |
| Checkout | 15 | 10 | Partial | Payment errors |
| Dashboard | 12 | 15 | Complete | None |
```

## QA Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning
- [ ] Review requirements and designs
- [ ] Create test plan
- [ ] Identify test scenarios
- [ ] Estimate effort and timeline
- [ ] Set up test environment

### Phase 2: Test Design
- [ ] Write test cases
- [ ] Review test cases with team
- [ ] Prepare test data
- [ ] Build regression suite
- [ ] Get Figma design access

### Phase 3: Execution
- [ ] Execute test cases
- [ ] Log bugs with clear steps
- [ ] Validate against Figma (UI tests)
- [ ] Track test progress
- [ ] Communicate blockers

### Phase 4: Reporting
- [ ] Compile test results
- [ ] Analyze coverage
- [ ] Document risks
- [ ] Provide go/no-go recommendation
- [ ] Archive test artifacts

## Best Practices

### Test Case Writing

**DO:**
- Be specific and unambiguous
- Include expected results for each step
- Test one thing per test case
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep test cases maintainable

**DON'T:**
- Assume knowledge
- Make test cases too long
- Skip preconditions
- Forget edge cases
- Leave expected results vague

### Bug Reporting

**DO:**
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Include screenshots/videos
- Specify exact environment details
- Describe impact on users
- Link to Figma for UI bugs

**DON'T:**
- Report without reproduction steps
- Use vague descriptions
- Skip environment details
- Forget to assign priority
- Duplicate existing bugs

### Regression Testing

**DO:**
- Automate repetitive tests when possible
- Maintain regression suite regularly
- Prioritize critical paths
- Run smoke tests frequently
- Update suite after each release

**DON'T:**
- Skip regression before releases
- Let suite become outdated
- Test everything every time
- Ignore failed regression tests
